Pre-RFC: The Module in- and outliner

# Inlining Take II

The next inliner will do inlining and outlining at module level in one
pass. Outlining might give more opportunities for inlining.


```c
Huge computesAlot(Huge *huge) {
   if (likely) {
     // less code
   } else { // unlikely
     // a lot of code
   }
}
```

Solution:
1. outline else-branch
2. inline function

## InOutlinerState

1. Functions
  1. CallOps
  2. Blocks
     1. Instructions
     2. Allocas
  3. Controlflow Graph
2. Callgraph
3. 

# PGO



# Design Principles

New passes are fat, do abstraction raising, state to state transforms,
cost modeling, and only write changes back to IR.

Wegman and Zadeck presented an algorithm that combines *constant
propagation* and *unreachable-code elimination*. IPSCCP in LLVM.
Click and Cooper talked about fat passes, i.e., *constant
propagation*, *value numbering*, and *uncreachable code elimination*.
